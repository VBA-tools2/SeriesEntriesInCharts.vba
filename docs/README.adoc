Excel VBA module to list chart + (accessible) series data.

You have Excel files with a lot of charts and don't have clue which data are (really) plotted?
To answer this question this project is good for.


== Features

List

* the sheet name,
* chart name,
* chart title, x/y/y2 axis labels,
* series name strings and, if it is a range, its path, workbook, worksheet and range,
* series x values, or, if it is a range, its path, workbook, worksheet and range,
* series y values, or, if it is a range, its path, workbook, worksheet and range,
* the axis group, and
* the "`visible`" and total plot order

of each series in the active workbook.

Additionally you can write extensions.
The only (public) so far is `modSeriesFormatting` which lists the marker

* symbol,
* foreground color, and
* background color

of scatter (like) series.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites / Dependencies

Since this is an Excel VBA module you obviously need Microsoft Excel.
You also need the following classes/modules:

* {uri-ChartSeries}[ChartSeries.vba]
* {uri-modArraySupport2}[modArraySupport2.vba]
* {uri-XLSpeedUp}[XLSpeedUp.vba]

[#how-to-install]
== How to install / Getting started

Add the CLS and BAS files from the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder to your project.
(Of course you have to follow the installation instructions for the <<prerequisites>> as well.)
Since you can use this tool for any workbook, it makes sense to put it in an AddIn.

._If you need some more advice on how to do that, expand me._
[%collapsible]
====
. Open Microsoft Excel.
. Open the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) (kbd:[Alt+F11]).
. Add the file(s) in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder to your VBA project.
** With {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck]:
.. Right-click on the project to which you want to add the file(s) in the "`Code Explorer`" (to show it press kbd:[Ctrl+R]) and click on menu:Add[Existing Files...].
.. Select all files in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder and click on btn:[Open].
** Without Rubberduck:
.. Select all files in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder in Windows File Explorer.
.. Drag-and-drop them to the corresponding project in VBE's "`Project Explorer`". +
   (To show it press kbd:[Ctrl+R].
   Hit it twice if the Code Explorer shows up first.)
// BUG: "project name" can't be put in normal angle brackets, because the closing bracket would be interpreted as menu delimiter. I couldn't find a way how to "escape" that (i.e. a backslash didn't work). Thus, single guillemets are used.
. Check, if there are obvious errors by compiling the project (menu:Debug[Compile â€¹project nameâ€º]).
. Save the file/project.
.. Be sure that the file/project you want to save is "`active`" in the VBE by checking, if its name is shown in VBE's title bar. +
   (If it's not, open a (class) module of the corresponding project (and close it again).)
.. Press the "`Save`" button (the disc symbol similar to ðŸ’¾) in VBE's toolbar.
.. Check that the file (really) was saved by having a look at the "`last modified date`" of the (project) file in the Windows File Explorer.
====

To have quick and easy access to the tool, you can add a button e.g. to the "`Quick Access Toolbar`".
The main macro/sub to run is `ListAllSCEntriesInAllCharts` in the `modSeriesEntriesInCharts` module.
As a symbol I usually use the pie chart icon (row 7, column 7).
(If you don't know how to do this, please google it.
There are plenty of resources on that topic including a lot of YouTube videos.)

== Usage / Show it in action

I tried to find a good Excel workbook with lots of charts that is publicly available.
Unfortunately I wasn't successful.
Please let know, if you can provide such a file or where to find one.

But of course you can test it with your own Excel files.
Simply hit the button which you (hopefully) have added to the Quick Access Toolbar (see the end of <<how-to-install>>).
When the macro has finished you will find the worksheet `SeriesEntriesInCharts` in the active workbook.
Have a look at it and see if you find the listed information useful.

== Running Tests

Yes, {uri-UnitTests}[Unit Tests] in Excel _are_ possible.
For that you need to have the awesome {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck] AddIn installed (and enabled).

But unfortunately for this (type of) project I don't have a clue what useful unit tests would be.
If you know some, please let me know.

[#used-by]
== Used By

I consider this project being an "`end product`".
Thus it is very unlikely that it is used in other projects (as is).
If you use it (modified) in another project and want to share it, please let me know and I'll be happy to list it here.

== Known issues and limitations

I almost exclusively work with scatter charts.
So I am not sure if this works for all the other chart types as well.

[#contributing]
== Contributing

All contributions are highly welcome!!

If you are new to git/GitHub, please have a look at {uri-GitHub-FirstContribution} where you will find a lot of useful information for beginners.

I recently was pointed to {uri-commit-messages} which sounds very promising.
I'll use them from now on too (and hopefully don't forget it in a hurry).

== FAQ

[qanda]
What are the `+'@...+` comments good for in the code?::
You should really have a look at the awesome {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck] project!
